## The problem
Task:
Write a program that prints the lyrics of the "99 Bottles of Beer" song from 99 to 1 bottle.

Lyrics Format:
The lyrics follow this pattern:

"""
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
"""

...and so on, until it reaches 1 bottle.

Rules:

- The lyrics are case-sensitive; make sure to match the exact capitalization.
- Pay attention to singular and plural forms ("1 bottle" vs. "2 bottles").
- The last verse should end with "1 bottle of beer on the wall" (singular form).

Your program should print all the verses in the correct order, one verse per line, following the pattern as described above.
