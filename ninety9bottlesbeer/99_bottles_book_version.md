## Problem
Task:
Write a program that prints the lyrics of the "99 Bottles of Beer" song from 99 to 1 bottle.

Lyrics Format:
The lyrics follow this pattern:

"""
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.

...

2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

"""




Rules:

- The lyrics are case-sensitive; make sure to match the exact capitalization.
- Pay attention to singular and plural forms ("1 bottle" vs. "2 bottles").

Your program should print all the verses in the correct order, one verse per line, following the pattern as described above.
